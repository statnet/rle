Common 'base' and 'stats' methods for 'rle' objects, aiming to make it possible to treat them transparently as vectors.


## Latest Windows and MacOS binaries

A set of binaries is built after every commit to the repository. We strongly encourage testing against them before filing a bug report, as they may contain fixes that have not yet been sent to CRAN. They can be downloaded through the following links:

* [MacOS binary (a `.tgz` file in a `.zip` file)](https://nightly.link/statnet/rle/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/master/macOS-rrelease-binaries.zip)
* [Windows binary (a `.zip` file in a `.zip` file)](https://nightly.link/statnet/rle/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/master/Windows-rrelease-binaries.zip)

You will need to extract the MacOS `.tgz` or the Windows `.zip` file from the outer `.zip` file before installing. These binaries are usually built under the latest version of R and their operating system and may not work under other versions.
